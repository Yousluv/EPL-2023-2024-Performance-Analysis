## 📝 Introduction
The EPL is one of the most competitive football leagues globally, and analyzing its season's data offers rich insights for stakeholders. This project demonstrates how data visualization can reveal patterns in team tactics, individual performances, and areas for improvement.

## 🎯 Objective
-	To analyze and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) of teams and players in the EPL 2023/2024 season.
-	To derive actionable insights and strategic recommendations for clubs and players.
-	To showcase dashboard-building, data cleaning, and analytical storytelling skills.

## 📊 Data Overview
The analysis is based on two interactive dashboards representing:
1.	Team Performance Data – Goals, points, wins, yellow/red cards, goal difference, goals conceded.
2.	Player Performance Data – Goals, assists, goal contribution %, saves, clean sheets, expected goals (xG).

## 🗂️ Data Description
Team-Level Metrics:
-	Total Points
-	Win Percentage
-	Goals Scored/Conceded
-	Goal Difference
-	Yellow/Red Cards

### Player-Level Metrics:
-	Goals + Assists
-	Conversion %
-	Saves
-	Clean Sheets
-	Expected Goals (xG)

## 🧹 Data Preparation and Cleaning
-	Aggregated stats per club and player were sourced and cleaned for consistency.
-	Player names and team names were standardized.
-	Duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent labels (e.g., "N.Forest" → "Nottingham Forest") were corrected.
-	Expected goals (xG) were matched with actual goals for variance analysis.

## 🧪 Methodology
-	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to identify high-impact variables.
-	Comparative ranking was done using horizontal bar charts.
-	Goal efficiency was measured by comparing goals scored vs expected goals.
-	Defensive strength was assessed by clean sheets and goals conceded.
-	Offensive effectiveness was evaluated through conversion rate and total contributions.

## 🛠 Tools Used
-	Power BI for interactive dashboard design and visualization
-	Microsoft Excel for initial data wrangling
-	Canva for design polishing (optional)
-	GitHub for project documentation and sharing

## 📈 Recommendations for Teams
1.	Arsenal & Man City: Continue balancing attacking and defensive strengths—both clubs showed high goal difference and low goals conceded.
2.	Liverpool & Tottenham: Focus on tightening defense; they conceded more despite strong attacks.
3.	Relegation-Zone Clubs (e.g., Sheffield United): Drastically improve both offense and defense; tactical overhaul needed.
 4.	Mid-table teams: Analyze player efficiencies to unlock value from underutilized talent.

## 🧑‍✈️ Recommendations for Players
1.	J. Mateta: Leverage high conversion rate for more consistent playtime or potential transfer to bigger clubs.
2.	C. Palmer: Already contributing heavily; focus on improving conversion efficiency (currently at 20.2%).
3.	Goalkeepers like A. Onana & Kaminski: High save counts suggest strong reflexes, but teams must bolster defense to reduce exposure.
4.	Strikers with low xG but high output: Continue overperforming expected goals but prepare for regression to mean.

### 🧠 Strategic Recommendations for Arsenal (2024/2025)
1. Add a Clinical Finisher
Despite a great goal difference, Arsenal lacked a Golden Boot-level striker.
Recommendation: Sign or develop a 20+ goal striker to rival Haaland. Gabriel Jesus and Nketiah are good but inconsistent.
Consider a bid for a high-efficiency player like Ollie Watkins or Alexander Isak.

2. Improve Squad Rotation
Key players (e.g., Saka, Ødegaard) are over-relied upon in critical stretches.
Recommendation: Add depth in wide forward and attacking midfield positions to prevent burnout.
3. Enhance Set-Piece Conversion
Arsenal creates chances from corners but doesn’t convert at an elite rate.
Recommendation: Hire a specialist set-piece coach or invest in tall, aerially dominant attackers.
4. Increase Game Control vs Top 6
While Arsenal beat weaker sides convincingly, they dropped points in "6-pointer" matches.
Recommendation: Improve game management and tactical flexibility against teams like City, Liverpool, and Spurs.
5. Continue Defensive Discipline
Maintain focus on disciplined defending (few red/yellow cards) and tactical pressing.
Recommendation: Keep core defenders fit and ensure David Raya remains first-choice with confidence

## Conclusion
This analysis not only highlights exceptional performances but also surfaces inefficiencies and untapped potential in both individuals and clubs. The visual dashboards serve as a powerful storytelling tool for analysts, scouts, managers, and fans alike.
